Moreover, we can generate a report and graph. Using this extra function needs to install *texLive* `here

>>> absconbest

Contribution
------------

Use and extend our package freely please. Look at the files in our repository. For us, many files are meaningless. They are auto-generated by *setuptools*, a Python package, which builds Python source codes for distribution. So for developing our Python package, ignore all the files other than:

>>> ls absconbest_payroll/*.py
