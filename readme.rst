==================================

The xlsx file works well with both MS and Libreoffice. eg)
   >>> libreoffice ~/Desktop/absconbest_payroll/absconbest_payroll.xlsx

The program adds a command that generates a report and graph.
   >>> generateAbsconbest

The report is saved at
   >>> "~/Desktop/absconbest_payroll/output/"
